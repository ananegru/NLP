This assignment entailed building an assistant to understand, learn and study the content of web pages related to academic articles for the purpose of facilitating learning about subfields of AI, such as NLP. The assistant leverages capabilities of the large language model (LLM) GPT3.5 in order to allow users to input a url belonging to an academic article and then be able to ask questions to the assistant to explain or clarify specific parts of the article. The assistant can also provide summaries or explain concepts using simpler language. All information that is explained is taken directly from the article.
